# steps to run

1. Record samples of voice (2 minutes length) of three different people with this file https://github.com/YaroslavGrushko/prototype-Auto/blob/master/recordBigText.py
(to record person voice only launch .py file above and the person should read any text trough 2 minutes to microphone that connected to your computer). It's automatically stops recording after 2 minutes of recording and save to demo.wav . Rename demo.wav with name of person that read text, for example for me it will be yaroslav.wav and save it to real_voices_texts folder of prototype project. Do the same with do the same with two other people. 
o now you have database of voices of 3 different people 2 minutes duration each.
